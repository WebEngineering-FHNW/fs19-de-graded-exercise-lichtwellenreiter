Project idea short description: 

#### General Idea
The goal is to add an extra level of gamification to the personal study planning. The module Path should be displayed as a progress path. With gems you can unlock modules on your path on the journey to 180 Credits. When all Keys are found in the four different worlds "Foundation", "Became Expert", "Context" and "Project" you are able to unlock and open the Gates to the Final Boss "Thesis".
Let's call it:  

```
    ___                                          _     _     ___             _ _ _       
   /   \_   _ _ __   __ _  ___  ___  _ __  ___  ( ) __( )   / __\ __ ___  __| (_) |_ ___ 
  / /\ / | | | '_ \ / _` |/ _ \/ _ \| '_ \/ __| |/ '_ \/   / / | '__/ _ \/ _` | | __/ __|
 / /_//| |_| | | | | (_| |  __/ (_) | | | \__ \  | | | |  / /__| | |  __/ (_| | | |_\__ \
/___,'  \__,_|_| |_|\__, |\___|\___/|_| |_|___/  |_| |_|  \____/_|  \___|\__,_|_|\__|___/
                    |___/                                                                                                                  
```

#### Inspiration
Inspiration for the path was found in the Map design of SuperMario Bros 3:

or the Minecraft Crafting Achievement Map:

#### Implementation
The Application consists of "normal" CRUD Operations and REST Endpoints. As Addition i will try to add a level of graph theory to determine the Paths. 

A small PoC can be found in this [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/lichtwellenreiter/vr5e7fg3/) because I don't wan't rely on huge JS Framworks.

## Project confirmation

Cool. That sounds like considerable effort, though.
Try to find a way to have a simple version running and expand from there.

Confirmed.
